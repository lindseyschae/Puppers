CBARQ Data, Final Model Report


Problem: Can you predict behaviors based on a dog’s breed?
Data: CBARQ Behavioral Assessment, data gathered from a survey polling individuals about their dog’s behavior, using a scale of 1-5.
Model: Supervised Linear Regression
Preprocessing Steps: 
* Eliminated rows with more than 5 values missing and imputed the rest with the means of their category; 
* Imputed outliers in columns which had few outliers with the value of IQR x 2; 
* Standardized responses for Mixed Breed dogs;
* Limited dataset to the most common 10 breeds; 
* Added “1” to all values in all columns to better reflect the original results of the survey;
* Eliminated heavily negative-biased categories, leaving 5: “energy”, “excitability”, “attachatten” (attachment and attention-seeking behavior), “chasing”, and “trainability”;
* Examined correlations and differences in aggregated trait values between breeds;
* Conducted an ANOVA test to determine whether those values were significant enough to be differentiated;
* Created dummy variables for the “BreedID” category;
* Separated breeds into the X and traits into y variables;
* Further split data into training and test sets (70/30);
* Used a random state of 55 for repeatability.
Model: 
* Final data shape:
   * X: (5629, 10)
   * y: (5629, 5)
* Model iterations:
   * Linear
   * Lasso
   * XGBoost
   * Random Forest Regressor
* Final model: Linear Regression
   * The best negative MSE score for the Linear Regression model is -0.7485746361602028
   * The best parameters are {'copy_X': True, 'fit_intercept': True, 'positive': True}
   * The model's NMSE training CV score is -0.747773582924948
   * The model's NMSE testing CV score is -0.7426515099102272
   * Hyperparameters were determined by a GridSearchCV of 10 iterations
